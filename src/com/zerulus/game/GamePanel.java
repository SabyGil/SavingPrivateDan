    /*
        Questions:
        1. what does runnable do?
        2. why does the run method need a thread? ok in the video he had the thread inside the run method but then moved it into addNotify... why?
        3. what is the init method for?
        4. how did he know he would need a render & draw method? what is about the code that implies that those methods are necessary?
